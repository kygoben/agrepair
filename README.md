## Inspiration
Our group members have varying interests in finance and noticed a significant lack of fun or accessible information about different financial concepts for younger audiences, especially students in underfunded schools. We aimed to address this gap through FinTeach.

## What it does
FinTeach targets students, primarily in middle and high school, with two main goals:
1. Provide financial education that is accessible to younger students.
2. Make learning about finance fun and engaging.

## How we built it
To maximize accessibility, we chose Flutter for development. This framework allows our app to be versatile across various devices, ensuring that users can access it whether they are on a laptop, phone, or other devices.

## Challenges we ran into
- The 11-hour drive from Ames, IA to Dallas, TX.
- Pivoting our project idea to align with the sponsor challenges.
- Learning and working with Flutter as a new technology.
- Deployment challenges due to our inexperience with Flutter.
- The struggle to find whiteboards for planning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully diving into and learning about Flutter.
- Designing with our target audience in mind.
- Eventually finding a whiteboard after an extensive search.

## What we learned
Our team gained significant experience in using Flutter, Dart, and Material to build various parts of the UI, enhancing our technical skillset.

## What's next for FinTeach?
Future enhancements include:
- Tailoring the question generation process to the user's skill level.
- Adding sub-modules for each topic for a more in-depth experience.
- Integrating a dictation option for accessibility.
